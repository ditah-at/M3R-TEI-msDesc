                                Liturgical Psalter, comprising 151 psalms according to the Septuagint, originally with 
                                Cantica and further texts at the end (as in the somewhat older Psalterium Sinaiticum), 
                                from which only the title of the first Canticum is preserved. Spaces left over for miniatures 
                                were later used by Demetrius for a circle of later entries.

Partly old material was used, sometimes washed and/or scraped off before reuse and showing remains of old lines, scrapes or shavings, rarely also of possible script-remnants. Correspondingly, the color of the leaves also changes and ranges from pale yellow to the brown of darkened hair sides, especially in the beginning (between ff. 1 and 27r) and final part (from f. 139v). Individual pages are also roughened (cf. ff. 1v and 43r) or show darkened pores.

                                    The 145 ff. are arranged in altogether 19 quires and form 17 quaternios, 
                                    one ternio and one binio. The penultimate sheet of the last quaternio is missing, 
                                    resulting in the following formula: <formula>2x8+1x4+1x6+14x8+1x7 [8-1]</formula>. Altogether we are 
                                    dealing with 72 bifolia and a single leaf, the former partner of f. 140. The quires 
                                    are prepared for combination by slits and are not pricked.

                                    Comparatively well, but about 2-3 quaternios (ca. 16-24 ff.) at the end 
                                    missing with lost text and one folio without text loss within the last 
                                    quaternio (f. 144’). It seems to have been preserved for an emblematic 
                                    miniature.
                                    46 ff. show more severe mechanical damage, but only a few of them with 
                                    (mostly minor) text loss (ff. 1, 51, 52, 53, 111r, 118r, 119v, 131r, 139r, 
                                    144v, 145v). The legibility of the text can be impaired in places by dirt 
                                    or sand, water stains, fading and rejection of the ink, as on ff. 1v, 8v, 
                                    32v, 33v, 34v, 42v etc.).
                                    In addition to holes or cutouts that were already present (larger ones on 
                                    ff. 21 and 33) in the parchment, there are sometimes also later holes 
                                    (as on ff. 1 and 51-53) or cutouts (as on f. 34, from which the entire 
                                    upper third is missing), frayed or eroded edges, inturned corners, 
                                    scrapes and the like. Regrettable is the loss of part of the tripartite 
                                    abecedarium on f. 1r. From f. 4v the left part of the initial is missing 
                                    due to trimming, etc.

                                    <p>The ruled lines are subject to large fluctuations. Thus, their number is initially 17-20 (in exceptional cases caused by old lining up to approx. 23/24), and subsequently between 24-29, with an average of 25 lines. The ruling is irregular over long distances. In many cases we are dealing with old and new lines, which are not always objectively  distinguishable without microscope. Nevertheless, some basic statements can be made: First, the ms. was obviously ruled by several people, who predominantly used a basic scheme. What they have in common, is that they worked quickly, so numerous transition patterns can be observed. The ruling manner is clearly discernable, e.g., on the middle bifolium ff. 118v+119r, where some lines are not completely continuous, but interrupted and taken up again. Of the traces of complex rulings, some are certainly related to the last writing, but others stem from an earlier, perhaps only partial text layer, as on f. 21v. This also suggests various instruments used for the rulings. Among the complex rulings there are multiple lines from one side, but individual ones (as a rule verticals, such as the right one on f. 5v, but now and then also horizontals, e.g., on ff. 12, 18, 21, 28) were added from the other side. The old lines, some of which are accompanied by different prickings, fall into at least two groups: one of more (f. 1) or less (ff. 26, 27) lines running diagonally to the last line, which suggests somewhat larger dimensions of the original sheet. And on quite a few folios, e.g., on ff. 12, 13, 17, 18, 28, 30-35 etc., one gets the impression that there is still an older ruling running at right angles to the last one, as in palimpsest-mss. <seg type="pricking">It includes the remains of old prickings on the upper and sometimes also the lower (in the case of a rotated sheet, outer or inner) margin, e.g., on ff. 13 and 41.</seg> In the majority of cases, the opened quire was ruled from top (inside) to bottom (outside), each bifolium separately, such as in quire 10. However, indirect lines do occur, e.g., in quires 1, 3-5, 7, 18 and maybe 6. However, only quires 3-4 and 18 reveal a rule in this respect. Exceptionally, there are also rulings that were made over the folded bifolium, for example in quires 1, 2, 5 and 7. In addition, at least twice the bifolium was not lined in its entirety, but only one half, namely f. 13r in quire 2 and f. 66r (partially) in quire 9. Such rare variants can also be observed in the Psalterium Sinaiticum and in the Medical Folia. The only recurring ruling type is the pattern (&lt;&lt;)&lt;&lt;ǁ&gt;&gt;(&gt;&gt;), which occurs in several variants at least in seven cases (quires 3, 4, 7, 9-12, 19). The ruling was executed predominantly from the hair side, although there are also ample examples of flesh side ruling. Where lines are also drawn from the opposite side, it can either be an archaic practice, contamination of old and new lines, or mere corrections.
<seg type="pricking">Prickings: Here also various differences can be observed, but the differences in the position only partly result from deliberate deviations, and often come from the folio shape and its trimming. Therefore, only the total number of prickings, the position (inside vs. outside) and the type and thus also the instrument of their execution (punctiform insertion of a stylus or punctorium vs. shorter or longer cut, caused by the use of a knife) are decisive. As a rule, one can assume that the outer prickings, almost always cut with a knife, are the ones that apply to the main text and that possible traces on the inside can at least partly come from older prickings.</seg></p>
                                        <p>The main scribe A does not always stick to the lines, which also results in differences between the lined and the written lines. With the exception of the last f. 145v with 11 lines their minimum number is 15, the maximum number 29, while we most frequently observe 24-26 written lines. In the smallest, B-part of the manuscript, the number of lines varies between 17 and 21, the average being 18-19 written lines. The C-hand, which covers about halfway between the other two, shows (apart from the transitional page of parts B and C and the last page 34r with only 11 lines) 16-23, but mostly 19-20 written lines.</p>

                            <handNote>Several scribes were responsible for the text of the Psalter: three scribes can be distinguished in the original part (A, B, C), and short insertions of a minor hand (A1) as well as at least two correctors. Part A covers about 80.18% of the text (ff. 1v, 2r21-22, 3r1-13, 35r-140r13, 141r-143v, 144v-145v), part B about 6.1% (ff. 2v, 3v-14r11), while the third hand C is involved with just over 11% (ff. 14r12-34r). The writing of all scribes generally hangs from the top line, but especially in the C section, there are numerous fluctuations in the direction of a standing or floating script. All of them use Cyrillic interspersions, particularly in the headings, whose paleography reveals clear differences between A and the other copyists. Taken together, the paleographic specifics assign at least the main scribe, but in all probability also his (main) corrector, to the western part of the Balkan Peninsula; cf., e.g., the occasionally occurring Latin-influenced Cyrillic E with a closed loop (e.g., ff. 35v12-13, 95v24-25), the similar Glagolitic Ęs (e.g., f. 35r24) and the right part of the nasal digraphs (ff. 35v6, 36r6 etc.). The latter feature is also found relatively frequently in the Medical Folia, which offers a certain indication of the common origin or training of the scribes. The assumption of a Western-Latin influence is also supported by occasional interruptions in the scriptura continua (cf. ff. 37v10, 17; 38r23; 38v1, 40v1 etc.), although the scribe does not always correctly grasp the word boundaries.</handNote>
                            <handNote scribe="demetrius">The scribe (Demetrius Sinaiticus) writes the on existing lines, which he mostly disregards, as well as vertical page margins. Thus, his ductus is partly hanging, partly standing or floating. The constantly changing letter size and slant, pronounced variety and frequent orientation to the style of his colleagues are indications of the lack of classical writing training.</handNote>

                            <p>There is no preserved illumination, and the empty space foreseen for illuminations was covered by Demtrius’s secondary entries. However, all three scribes of the Psalter text show decorated initials colored in an ocher-yellow, organic dye, which often was “washed” over the relevant passages, i.e., applied without precise consideration of the letter contours. Individual yellow markings are distinguished by an additional proportion of arsenic and sulfur, suggesting the use of arsenic sulfide (auripigment or realgar).</p>
                            <p>In addition to these open colorings, there are also closed colorings, especially in large initials and marginalia such as the psalm counts, which are partially or completely surrounded by circles, see, e.g. ff. 50r, 51r, 52v. The filling can sometimes take place within the letter contours, sometimes also in the spaces between them. There are certain differences in the way of coloring between the copyist B and the other two hands of the Psalter, as hand B almost exclusively fills in the headings, while the main copyist A only decides to do so towards the end of the writing process.</p>
                            <p>Overall, these data remind particularly of the Psalterium Sinaiticum (whose red and blue markings are obviously later overpaintings).</p>

                <p>The multidisciplinary analysis of historical manuscripts generates a variety of digital
                    artifacts: these range from multi- and hyperspectral images, spectroscopic and
                    microbiological material analyses, codicological and conservaional descriptions, to
                    transcriptions and philological editions. Within the project Digital Transformation of the
                    Austrian Humanities (DiTAH), a repository for the archiving and dissemination of these
                    diverse data is being developed. Within MultiModal Manuscript Representations, the various
                    data streams and metadata are spatially and logically related and combined to virtual
                    objects, which are disseminated via a graphical web viewer and technical interfaces using
                    established standard (IIIF, METS, TEI, SKOS). In this way, multidisciplinary manuscript
                    research data shall be made easily accessible and re-usable in research in the humanities,
                    natural sciences and technology as well as for university teaching of technical methods and
                    resources in the humanities. For a prove of concept, the repository is currently populated
                    with data that has been continuously produced as part of the research of the Vienna Centre
                    for Image and Material Analysis in Cultural Heritage (CIMA).</p>
